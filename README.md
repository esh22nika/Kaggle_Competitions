This directory contains my work for various Kaggle machine learning competitions. Each competition has its own subfolder that includes code, notebooks, submission files, and documentation specific to that competition.

The goal of maintaining this structure is to organize competition work consistently and make it easier to reference models, results, and approaches in the future.
